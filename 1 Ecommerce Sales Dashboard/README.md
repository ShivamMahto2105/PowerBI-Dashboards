# 🛒 E-commerce Sales Dashboard

## Welcome!

This Was My First PowerBI Dashboard.
This project presents a fully interactive **E-commerce Sales Dashboard** created with Microsoft Power BI. It enables businesses to easily track, explore, and analyze their online sales data through dynamic visualizations and user-driven insights.

## 📈 Project Highlights
Built an interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data across time periods, product categories, and customer segments.

Used complex parameters, filters, and slicers to allow drill-down analysis and customized exploration.

Created data model connections, joined new tables, and used DAX formulas to manipulate and transform data for deeper analysis.

Used user-driven parameters for enhanced interactivity.
